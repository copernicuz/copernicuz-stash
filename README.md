# stash-copernicuz

Custom Stash scripts I've written and use.

## Installing

In Stash, go to Settings > Interface > Custom JavaScript and enable it.

Then simply copy & paste the contents of a script.

## Why not a userscript?

I don't like userscripts because they're not easily portable between browsers. Adding scripts to Stash directly allows for easier backup, and it instantly works across all browsers.
